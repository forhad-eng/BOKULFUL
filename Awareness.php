<h1>How do you manage to get video of every individual plant? How often are they updated?</h1>
<h3>Our individual videos emerged out of our individualized care-system for each plant. every plant was already being
individually imaged to monitor its health, so one day we started posting them to the website and then people started
emailing in asking for specific plants so we thought; why not share all the photos and videos.</h3>
